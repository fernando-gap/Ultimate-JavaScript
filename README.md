# Ultimate-JavaScript

## Why?
I'm simply want to represent JavaScript in a simple way, I'm trying out to make the things that are in MDN docs more easily, showing simple examples, if you want something that go deeper I recommend you see the offcial docs. The mainly purpose of this is to "refresh" my mind in something that I forget, Mostly it's something trivial. Thanks!
